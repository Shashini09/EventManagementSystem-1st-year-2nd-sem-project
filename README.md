Creating an event management system as a group project in my 1st year, 2nd semester. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development, and PHP for backend development on an Apache Tomcat server. The project includes CRUD operations and utilizes Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for database management. My role in this project involves managing the calendar functionality and developing the add reminder page.
